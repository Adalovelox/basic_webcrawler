# basic_webcrawler


This file anonymously lists out all the links on a webpage. I recommend dirbuster or dirb instead, but if you need extra customizability here you go. Make sure you have installed mechanize and beautifulsoup4. Uncomment out the block of code to enter inputs. I place this up here for reference and future improvements.
